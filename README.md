## Overview

Alpha Authenticator is a secure, reliable, and user-friendly two-factor authentication (2FA) app designed to enhance your account security. It generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) and supports multiple accounts with ease. The app is built primarily for Android platforms using React Native and Expo, with a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Key Features

Secure TOTP Generation: Generates time-based one-time passwords for your accounts.

Account Management: Add, edit, and manage multiple accounts with unique keys.

Biometric Authentication: Use fingerprint or face recognition for quick access.

QR Code Scanning: Easily add accounts by scanning QR codes.

Dark Mode Support: Switch between light and dark themes based on your preference.

JWT Authentication: Secure communication between the client and the server.

## How It Works

Add an Account:

Open the app and click on "Add Account."

Scan a QR code or manually enter the app name and secret key.

Generate Codes:

Select an account to view the generated TOTP.

Use the TOTP to log into your desired service.

Enhanced Security:
